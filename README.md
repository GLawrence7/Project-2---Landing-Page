## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Development

Navbar is generated using JavaScript, new links will be added if any new section is added to the page.

On scroll the navbar will disappear, it will appear again when the page is static.

When section 2 or below is the active section, a floating button will appear that will take the user back to the top of the page.
